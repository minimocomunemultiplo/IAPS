# The SENTINEL-2A instrument acquires measurements at 12 bits. These measurements are converted to reflectances and stored as 16 bit 
# integers in the S2 product. The Level-2A processing includes a Scene Classification and an Atmospheric Correction applied to 
# Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) Level-1C orthoimage products. Level-2A main output is an orthoimage atmospherically corrected, Surface 
# Reflectance product.
