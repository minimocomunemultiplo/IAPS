# The SENTINEL-2A instrument acquires measurements at 12 bits. These measurements are converted to reflectances and stored as 16 bit 
# integers in the S2 product. The Level-2A processing includes a Scene Classification and an Atmospheric Correction applied to 
# Top-Of-Atmosphere (TOA) Level-1C orthoimage products. Level-2A main output is an orthoimage atmospherically corrected, Surface 
# Reflectance product.

##################### DATA CLEANING AND PREPARATION ##################

# Now we need to get deeper into the analysis. For this, we will take reference at Roach et al. (2006).
# They worked with a spatial resolution of 8 meters and detected 126 bands covering 0.45-2.5 micrometers.
# They considered a 25x25 pixels (200 x 200 meters) area.

# In our case, these images have a 10 meter resolution. This means that each pixel represents a 10x10 m surface area.
# If we plot the image using false color, we will have reflectance values for IR, red and green frequencies composing each pixel.
# For the 10 meter resolution, our images ONLY have one blue band (490 nm), green band (560 nm), red band (665 nm), and IR band (842 nm). 
# If we used a smaller scale image (such as 20 m, or 60 m), we'd have more bands to be used. 
# In order to keep it as simple as possible, we've chosen to proceed with a 10 m resolution.

plotRGB(rt23, 4,3,2, stretch ="lin") # take a look at this false color image.

# We must get rid of vegetation, water and urban context. For vegetation we can use NDVI calculation
# Calculate NDVI = (Band NIR â€“ Band RED) / (Band NIR + Band RED).

NDVI <- (rt23[[4]]-rt23[[3]])/(rt23[[4]]+rt23[[3]])
NDVI
plot(NDVI, col = viridis(100))

threshold_ndvi <- 0.23 # Define your threshold for NDVI
mask_above_threshold <- NDVI > threshold_ndvi # Create a mask for pixels above the threshold.
plot(mask_above_threshold) # check the mask.
getValues(mask_above_threshold) # Just to check data type of mask. It's logical, so TRUE if value is 1 and FALSE if it is 0.
rt23_mask <- rt23 # Create a copy of the original stack to keep the original data intact
rt23_mask[mask_above_threshold==TRUE] <- NA # Set pixels above the threshold (TRUE) to NA (only for the NIR layer).
plotRGB(rt23_mask, 4,3,2, stretch = "lin") # Plot the adjusted image by combining the original RGB bands with the adjusted NDVI band

##### there is a problem with the rendering of the colors (?) I can't understand why they slightly change in the overall image.
##### Probably there happens a minimal subtraction of layers also on the part of the image not cathegorized as vegetation.
##### anyway..
