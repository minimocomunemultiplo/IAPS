# IAPS
Also, in this repository I will share with you my codes for IAPS institute in Rome. Part of this work will be used to develop my master thesis.

Work is in progress, so I will probably update files as I go further into studying and tinkering the techniques. I am learning R, and these should act as checkpoints of my work.
All of the work in this repository is stored to be a recap of my thesis workflow. It's mainly a reference for me, to control my steps and gradually improve.

All the code is usually presented by a .pdf I upload in this repository. Please, find the right .pdf and let it guide you through the code for better comprehension.

Thanks for your understanding.
Jack.
